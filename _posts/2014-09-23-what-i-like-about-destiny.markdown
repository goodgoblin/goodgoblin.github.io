What I love about Destiny
=========================
OK, I feel really bad for the people over at Bungie who worked for years on Destiny only to have it get slammed by reviewers on release.  It seems to me that all these reviewers are trying to do is point out what they don't like about the game.  Frankly I find their criticisms to be petty and indicative of their own lack of imagination.  Everything about the world that they claim is "cold and empty" could more aptly describe themselves.  I love the artwork, the attention to detail.  It makes playing the game enjoyable the same way walking down the street of a major city is enjoyable -- the number of random things that humans have spent an inordinate amount of time working on is uplifting.  Row upon row of gigantic sconces, endless sculptures 300 feet in the air, the ceilings of former bank headquarters, etc.  Destiny has enough of these extra elements to leave me feeling impressed rather than childishly disappointed.  

I also love how there is a story, but the details are not all filled in.  That is what your imagination is for.  Let's face it: no one is really going to believe the story anyway, but there has to be some kind of scaffold to hang the game upon.  The narrative they settled on is intentionally vague and the tropes they incorporated represent storyteling shorthand rather than banal idea-fails.
